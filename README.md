# Interpolation-Search
This is my implementation of the Interpolation Search algorithm for words in a list.

## Motivation :ski:
---
This was one of my coursework during 1st year.

### Features
- It sorts the list, if it was not already sorted.
- It returns the position of the item in the original list, if not found it returns -1.

### Technical Information
This was developed using [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). It contains a main method for testing.

### Known Issues/Limitations
The program is **case sensitive**. If user wants to find position of "hello" in "Hello World" it will return -1.

### Screenshots

Searching for word "Is" in "Hello World Are You How This Is For Testing"
